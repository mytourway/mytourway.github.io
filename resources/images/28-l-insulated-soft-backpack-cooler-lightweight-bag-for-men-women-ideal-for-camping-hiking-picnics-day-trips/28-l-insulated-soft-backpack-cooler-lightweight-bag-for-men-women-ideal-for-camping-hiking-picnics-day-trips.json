The outer material is also water repellent to help keep your kit dry. Please note, we don&apos;t recommend that you put ice directly in the backpack, as it has stitched seams and is not leakproof. Instead, to give you the best performance (&amp; to keep you dry!) we recommend the use of flexible reusable ice packs. <b>Tip:</b> If you only have a single ice pack, place it near the top of the bag as cool air sinks. </p><p> <b>Take advantage of our special launch price ($25.99 down from $40) before this offer ends!</b><br></p><p><b>Peace of Mind</b><br> If you don&apos;t love it, return it within 30 days for a full refund!\n\t\t\t\t    \t\n\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n        \t\t\n        \t\t\n        \t\n        \n                \n        \n        \n      \n      \n    \n    <p></p>","features":["Make sure this fits\n                by entering your model number.","LAUNCH PRICE! $25.99 DOWN FROM $40.
